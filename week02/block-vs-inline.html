        <h1>Exercise: Block vs. Inline Elements</h1>
        <p class="note">Some basic styling has been applied in order to illustrate the elements
            structure and
            boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Task 1: Swap Block and Inline Elements</h2>
        <span>In the HTML of this document, change this div element to a span element.</span>

        <p class="question">What happens to the layout? Does it still take up the full width?</p>
        <!--Shrinks to only fill it's content; no it does not. -->

        <h2>Task 2: Nesting Inline in Block</h2>
        <p>A paragraph &lt;p&gt; element (block) with a <span>&lt;span&gt; element; <strong> adding
                    another inline element inside the paragraph</strong></span>
            <strong> adding one here as well</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="question">Add another inline element like &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; inside the
            paragraph. Observe
            how it flows within the line. <strong>Inline element here too</strong></p>

        <h2>Task3: Nesting Block in Inline</h2>
        <span>Try placing a &lt;div&gt; inside a &lt;span&gt; element. <div>div element here</div>
        </span>
        <p class="question">What error or layout issue do you see? Why does this happen?</p>
        <!--Instead of keeping it inline, it broke it out into another row. It seems to have just extended the row/box to include the next row as a continuation. for example when I put a border around the span, the border cuts off as the div starts and ends the line after the div ends. it does not encompass the entire area but creates a discontinuity with the border.  -->


        <h2>Task 4: Review the HTML markup of the following Inline Elements</h2>
        &lt;img&gt; element
        <img src="images/castle.webp" alt="placeholder image (images are inline)" width="300"
          height="300">
        <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">&lt;a&gt; anchor element</a>
        <button type="button">&lt;button&gt; element</button>
    </main>
