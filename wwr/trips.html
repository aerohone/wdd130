                        </span> (ages 5+), we go over all of the basics
                        in rafting.
                        From
                        selecting appropriate gear, the importance of safety, how to paddle and
                        steer
                        and most important: how to save your kids after falling in. This is all done
                        in
                        a grass field next to a splash pad to limit danger for the little ones.
                        Children
                        under 12 years old must be accompanied by someone over 12 years of age. This
                        is
                        a half day adventure.*

                        (ages 7+), we hit the river
                        where
                        after an hour of practice there is a single 1 foot rapid in the river.
                        Everyone
                        will have the chance to stick their feet out the front of the raft as it
                        hits
                        the rapid (children have priority) where the group then walks back up the
                        river
                        to do it again. This is a full day adventure.* </figcaption>

                        </span> (age 21+) we take a
                        gander
                        down the aptly named Drowning River. Death Wish Rafting Company is the only
                        rafting company to sponsor adventures down this river. It comprises of two
                        miles
                        of rapids that force a group to do high speed maneuvers to avoid whirlpools
                        that
                        claim the lives of 80% of rafters that fall into them. But don't worry! Your
                        body will get spit out down river half a mile. This is a full day
                        adventure.*

                        </span> (age 21+) we float down a
                        river
                        down with sheer cliffs on either side. The rock formations and waterfalls
                        provide a great picture moment for families. But watch out! The waterfalls
                        coming from both sides tend to fill up rafts quick. Rafters will get the
                        opportunity to work on their bailing skills as they hit 5 feet rapids that
                        like
                        to throw unwary rafters overboard. This is a ~3 day adventure*</figcaption>

                        river
                        that is
                        known for sharp rocky overhangs, rock formations that spit water upward and
                        into
                        rafters eyes, and a blind waterfall at the end if you don't pull out of the
                        river at the right spot, which is of course, around a blind corner. This is
                        another one of Death Wish Rafting Companies river adventures that is unique
                        to
                        rafting companies, the pansies. This is our most difficult adventure with a
                        95%
                        no return rate! We even have trouble paying guides to do this adventure.
