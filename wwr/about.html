            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p>This company started back January 1st 2000 when the founders, Fred and George,
                    decided that life was boring and not worth sitting around doing nothing. Fred
                    tried
                    a stunt with rock climbing and got what he later learned was an adrenaline rush.
                    He
                    was hooked. </p>
                <img src="images/rafting53-600.jpg" alt="rafters among rapids.">
                <p>He started seeking out ways to get another rush and brought his brother
                    George into it. They finally settled on river rapids as the perfect sport for
                    it.
                    Finding that they didn't want to go back to their boring desk jobs, they quit
                    and
                    started Death Wish Rafting Company for all adrenaline junkies and those who have
                    death wishes.</p>
